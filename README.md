# Schrodingers-Hack-2020

In 2020, my friends and I participated in (and won) Schrodinger's Hack, a physics-focused hackathon hosted at the University of Waterloo. Our submission was Exo-Vis, an educational tool simulating the red-shift created by exo-planets orbiting distant stars. Below is a link to a facebook post from Schrodinger's Hack announcing the winner, as well as a re-upload to youtube of our video submission. In the video you can see an example of how we intended the tool to be used; by adjusting the simulation of an orbiting body, you can view a graph showing what astronomers on earth would measure if observing the hypothetical system. We also auto-generate a python notebook with the graph and simulation, enabling students using the tool to easily experiment with and investigate how the simulation works.

In retrospect, I would've likely approached the UX design of the app very differently. It's a bit cumbersome to operate, and without additional instruction it isn't evident how the tool is meant to be used. However, given the time restraints of the hackathon format, I think the project turned out well, and we delivered on the core functionality we were looking for.
